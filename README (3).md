### Project Overview

Using SQL, this project explores water and sanitation data to compare access, functionality, and disease impact across different areas. It provides clear insights to guide interventions, improve infrastructure, and support policies that promote equitable access to clean water.


### Project Objectives

1.	Analyze water availability, sanitation costs, and the functionality of water points in various African communities.
2. Investigate the relationship between waterborne diseases and water access.
3. Provide actionable insights and recommendations for addressing water supply and sanitation issues.

### Key Insights

1. Several regions suffer from severe water scarcity, limiting daily water availability for residents.

2. Many water points are non-functional, disrupting consistent access to clean water in communities.

3. High sanitation maintenance costs in some areas indicate inefficiencies and infrastructure challenges.

4. In certain regions, people travel long distances to fetch water, creating daily hardships and reducing water usage.

5. Elevated rates of waterborne diseases in specific communities highlight urgent public health challenges linked to water quality and sanitation.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The government should prioritize repairing and maintaining non-functional water points to ensure reliable water access.

2. Increased government funding and oversight are needed to reduce high sanitation maintenance costs and improve system efficiency.

3. The government must implement targeted public health programs to address waterborne diseases in affected communities.

4. Investment in water infrastructure closer to residential areas should be a government priority to reduce the burden of long-distance water collection.
